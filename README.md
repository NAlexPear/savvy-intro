# Intro-Class
Here are the teaching and example materials for our Introductory Programming Class. In this repository, you will find:

+ A fully fleshed-out directory structure for the first website
+ Some neat code for a Javascript-based calculator
+ Not much else

If you would like to use this material in your own classes, just give me a shout out on Twitter @NAlexPear. 
If you're just learning the basics, you're more than welcome to use any of this material at any time.

Thanks for taking a look, and good luck with this class!
